The goal of this card is to develop a sublime-text plugin to enhance working with Maven projects

# DOD (definition of done):
All findings are documented.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Document all findings

# Reports:
* Step 1 - Find the folder path right clicked on the side bar
> * Find the root path of the side bar ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
> * Find absolute path of the selected item on the side bar ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
> * Find relative path of the selected item on the side bar ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
* Step 2 - Make the menu and other commands items dynamic
> * Update the `get_sidebar_folder.py` to use as the Maven plugin base
> * Change the static menu to a dynamic menu ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
> * Add path to the menu group title ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
* Step 3 - check a selected folder on the side bar is a Maven project folder/file
> * A selected item is inside a Maven project if the current selected folder or one of upper level folders has a `pom.xml` stored in ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-bri>
> * The upper level folders are scanned to find `pom.xml` up to the root folder inside of the side bar ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
> * Perhaps a xml check for `pom.xml` is required ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
* Step 4 - Reading/saving settings
> * Add a settings file and its loading method ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
* Step 5 - Adapt the Maven menu
> * Re-code the menu part to make it easy to add new items ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-DONE-brightgreen)
> * Check maven availability to enable disable menu items
> * Assign commands to menu items and find appropriate path of the project according to the method to run maven (host base or container base)
> * In the case of a container base maven if the project path cannot be converted to a known path for the container, the menu items are disabled
> * Finalize command implementation and find a solutions or way to show command running outputs
> * Work on the create command, adding types, and find how to ask the name of the project
> * List features than can be added later, not now with this card
